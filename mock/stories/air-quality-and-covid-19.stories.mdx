    ## Measuring Air Pollution on the Ground at Airports
    New research during the pandemic is also looking at how COVID-related travel bans are impacting air quality around airports. Current conditions create a unique opportunity to study airport-related pollutants, especially nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde. While travel bans and strict regulations around air travel have been in place, air traffic has yet to return to previous levels, and many planes remain grounded.

    They are comparing the on-the-ground sensor information from NASA's [Pandora Project](https://pandora.gsfc.nasa.gov/ "Explore the Pandora Project") with satellite information from TROPOMI. So far, they have found that nitrogen dioxide hotspots in Atlanta shifted from the airport, shown here, to the city center from April-June 2020. By September, however, satellites revealed the airport had reemerged as a dominant nitrogen dioxide emission source.

    ## Seeing Rebounds in NO2

    After the initial shock of COVID-related shutdowns in the spring, communities worldwide began to reopen and gradually increase mobility. Cars returned to the road, and travel restrictions slowly eased. These resumptions corresponded with relative increases in nitrogen dioxide levels and other air pollutants, as air quality levels began to return to pre-pandemic levels.

    This demonstrates how quickly atmospheric nitrogen dioxide responds to reductions in emissions. They will persist as long as emissions persist and decline rapidly if emissions are reduced.

    NASA scientists will continue to monitor nitrogen dioxide levels and long-term trends around the world. NASA is expected to launch its [Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO)](http://tempo.si.edu/overview.html "Explore the TEMPO instrument") instrument in 2022, which will provide hourly, high-resolution measurements of nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and other air pollutants across North America, improving future air quality forecasts.
