      The VEDA Dashboard is one of several user interfaces in the VEDA project.
      It also is aligned with VEDA’s goal of advancing interactive visualization
      and exploratory visual data analysis. This dashboard constitutes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        an evolution of COVID-19 dashboard to provide the interactive
        storytelling for various environmental changes using Earth observation
        data;
      </li>
      <li>
        a transformation of high-valued NASA datasets to dynamic visualization,
        enabling users to perform on-the-fly visual analysis;
      </li>
      <li>
        support for environmental justice initiatives through the integration of
        NASA Earth observation data and socio-economic data;
      </li>
      <li>
        a tool by which users can visually explore and localize data, and
        perform independent analysis; data-driven stories that are exportable in
        GIS formats;
      </li>
      <li>
        and a situational awareness system that brings together Earth
        observation datasets such as greenhouse gasses, air quality, and sea
        level rise, among others.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As an interactive visual interface for storytelling, the dashboard
      provides a number of capabilities including sharing and interacting with
      datasets and their respective stories. Through visualizations, trend
      analyses, and comparative analyses of datasets users can explore the
      applications and implications of those data. VEDA Dashboard will improve
      the usability of the Earth science data and enable faster science – one of
      the goals of the NASA open source science initiative. Please submit any
      feedback or questions using the Feedback button in the top right of the
      dashboard.
