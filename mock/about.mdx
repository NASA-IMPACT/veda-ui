    The VEDA Dashboard is one of several user interfaces in the VEDA project. It
    also is aligned with VEDA’s goal of advancing interactive visualization and
    exploratory visual data analysis. This dashboard constitutes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        an evolution of COVID-19 dashboard to provide the interactive
        storytelling for various environmental changes using Earth observation
        data;
      </li>
      <li>
        a transformation of high-valued NASA datasets to dynamic visualization,
        enabling users to perform on-the-fly visual analysis;
      </li>
      <li>
        a tool by which users can visually explore and localize data, and
        perform independent analysis; data-driven stories that are exportable in
        GIS formats;
      </li>
      <li>
        and a situational awareness system that brings together Earth
        observation datasets such as greenhouse gasses, air quality, and sea
        level rise, among others.
      </li>
    </ul>
    As an interactive visual interface for storytelling, the dashboard provides
    a number of capabilities including sharing and interacting with datasets and
    their respective stories. Through visualizations, trend analyses, and
    comparative analyses of datasets users can explore the applications and
    implications of those data. VEDA Dashboard will improve the usability of the
    Earth science data and enable faster science – one of the goals of the NASA
    open source science initiative. Please submit any feedback or questions
    using the Feedback button in the top right of the dashboard.
