    ## The component override

    The `ComponentOverride` is used to replace certain parts of the UI.  
    Through the `delta.config.js` the user can define a MDX file to load in a certain place.

    For example, the following configuration:
    ```
    pageOverrides: {
      aboutContent: './about.mdx',
      'sandbox-override': './sandbox-override.mdx'
    }
    ```

    states that the content fot the about page should come from the `./about.mdx` file, and that the content for this page should come from `./sandbox-override.mdx`.

    _Try to comment the `sandbox-override` line and re-run the project to see what happens._

    ### As a developer

    As a developer the `ComponentOverride` should be implement as follows:

    ```
    <ComponentOverride with='{key}'>
      <p>Some fallback content.</p>
    </ComponentOverride>
    ```

    The value of `{key}` can be any of the `pageOverrides` keys, passed as a string. If an override is privided, it will be rendered. Otherwise the fallback is rendered.

    To add a new override:
    1) Implement the `ComponentOverride` in the appropriate place defining a key.
    2) Add the key to the `delta/thematics` types (`parcel-resolver-thematics/index.d.ts`)

    Any other prop passed to `ComponentOverride` are avilable under `props.`:  
    **{JSON.stringify(props)}**
