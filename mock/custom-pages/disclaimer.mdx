    Ladies and gentlemen
    Welcome to the disclaimer
    That's right, the disclaimer
    This American apple pie institution
    Known as parental discretion
    Will cleanse any sense of innuendo or sarcasm
    From the lyrics which might actually make you think
    And will also insult your intelligence at the same time
    So protect your family
    This album contains explicit depictions
    Of things which are real
    These real things are commonly known as life
    So, if it sounds sarcastic, don't take it seriously
    If it sounds dangerous
    Do not try this at home or at all
    And if it offends you, just don't listen to it
  </Prose>
