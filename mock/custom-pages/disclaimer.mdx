    Ladies and gentlemen  
    Welcome to the disclaimer  
    That's right, the disclaimer this american apple pie institution  
    Known as parental discretion  
    Will cleanse any sense of innuendo or sarcasm  
    From the lyrics that might actually make you think  
    And will also insult your intelligence at the same time so protect your family  
    This album contains explicit depictions  
    Of things which are real  
    These real things are commonly known as life  
    So, if it sounds sarcastic, don't take it seriously  
    If it sounds dangerous  
    Do not try this at home or at all  
    And if it offends you, just don't listen to it
