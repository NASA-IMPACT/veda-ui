    Ladies and gentlemen<br/>
    Welcome to the disclaimer<br/>
    That's right, the disclaimer<br/>
    This American apple pie institution<br/>
    Known as parental discretion<br/>
    Will cleanse any sense of innuendo or sarcasm<br/>
    From the lyrics which might actually make you think<br/>
    And will also insult your intelligence at the same time<br/>
    So protect your family<br/>
    This album contains explicit depictions<br/>
    Of things which are real<br/>
    These real things are commonly known as life<br/>
    So, if it sounds sarcastic, don't take it seriously<br/>
    If it sounds dangerous<br/>
    Do not try this at home or at all<br/>
    And if it offends you, just don't listen to it
  </Prose>
