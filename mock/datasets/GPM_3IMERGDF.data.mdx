  ### About

  This dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG _Final_ Daily 10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDF) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHH. The derived result represents the Final estimate of the daily mean precipitation rate in mm/day. The dataset is produced by first computing the mean precipitation rate in (mm/hour) in every grid cell, and then multiplying the result by 24.
  
  As the "Final" product, it undergoes rigorous post-processing, including gauge calibration and quality checks, making it ideal for scientific research and operational applications. The dataset integrates observations from the GPM Core Observatory and partner satellites, leveraging advanced algorithms to provide reliable and consistent data. 

  Applications of this dataset include flood and drought monitoring, climate studies, water resource management, and environmental analysis. Its high spatial resolution, global coverage, and inclusion of retrospective corrections make it a critical resource for understanding precipitation patterns and dynamics.
