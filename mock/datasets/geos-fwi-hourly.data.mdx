    description:
      "Fire risk is determined by a combination of weather, climate and fuel conditions. One metric for determining fire risk is the Fire Weather Index (FWI), an index that is used in Alaska and internationally. FWI is a combination of many sub-metrics that look at different aspects of fire risk like fuel moisture, dryness, and wind. FWI helps scientists anticipate when fire will ignight or spread rapidly."
