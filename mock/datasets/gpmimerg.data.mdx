# GPM IMERG Final Precipitation L3 1 day 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V06 (GPM_3IMERGDF)

## Dataset Description

This dataset is the GPM Level 3 IMERG _Final_ Daily 10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDF) derived from the half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHH. The derived result represents the Final estimate of the daily mean precipitation rate in mm/day. The dataset is produced by first computing the mean precipitation rate in (mm/hour) in every grid cell, and then multiplying the result by 24.
