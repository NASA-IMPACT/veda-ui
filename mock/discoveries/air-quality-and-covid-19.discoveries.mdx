    As the pandemic has progressed, these scenarios have largely played out: during the strictest lockdown periods, locations around the world experienced substantial reductions in transportation-related fossil fuel emissions. The impacts on specific air pollutants have been varied and dependent on their lifespan in the atmosphere.

    ## What Makes Air Quality Good or Bad?

    Cities are easy to spot from space. Choose any large, urban area around the world, and you’re likely to see similar things: dense population centers, complex webs of highways and, more often than not, smog.

    Smog is the hazy curtain of air that often hangs over cities. It occurs when nitrogen dioxide produced from fossil fuel emissions from gasoline in cars or coal in powerplants chemically reacts with sunlight and other pollutants like carbon monoxide (CO). Thick smog is harmful to breathe and can significantly reduce visibility.

    During lockdowns, satellites observed sharp reductions in nitrogen dioxide emissions in cities around the world, and smog began to vanish. Skies were bluer, air was cleaner, and, in some places, views previously obscured by air pollution were suddenly revealed.

    ## Cities Experiencing Clearer Air During Lockdowns

    When Chinese authorities suspended travel and closed businesses in late January 2020 in response to the novel coronavirus, Beijing’s local nitrogen dioxide levels fell dramatically. In February 2020, concentrations fell by nearly 30% compared to the previous five-year average.

    ## Like Flipping a Switch: Lockdowns and NO2

    Nitrogen dioxide is only one component of air quality: sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), formaldehyde (CH2O), and carbon monoxide, along with a host of other atmospheric constituents, also influence the quality of the air we breathe. The difference in nitrogen dioxide is that it has a relatively short lifetime in the atmosphere; once it’s emitted, it only lasts a few hours before it disappears.
    
    Therefore, once communities entered shutdowns, and people’s mobility was severely restricted, the effect on nitrogen dioxide concentrations was the equivalent of flipping a switch. That is not, however, the case with all air pollutants.

    ## Seasonal Changes in NO2

    Even with the strong correlation between nitrogen dioxide and the combustion of fossil fuels, atmospheric concentrations of nitrogen dioxide naturally fluctuate throughout the year, and weather patterns also influence its concentrations.

    For example, nitrogen dioxide typically falls dramatically during spring and summer months, and rain and wind increase its dispersion, lowering local concentrations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, NASA scientists have been able to attribute the observed changes in nitrogen dioxide to changes in our behavior, and they have been careful to account for any impacts on air pollution that are the result of natural weather variations.

    ## Seeing Air Pollution from Space

    NASA has used the [Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)](https://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/omi.html "Explore the OMI product") aboard the Aura satellite to observe global nitrogen dioxide levels since 2004. A joint endeavor between NASA, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) and the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI), OMI's longer data record provides important context with which to compare any changes observed during the pandemic.
    
    NASA scientists are also leveraging other space-based instruments from international partners to study changes in nitrogen dioxide during the pandemic. These include the [TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)](http://www.tropomi.eu/ "Explore the TROPOMI product") aboard the European Commission’s Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite. Launched in 2016, TROPOMI provides higher resolution observations than OMI.

    ## Reinforcing Measurements: Nighttime Lights

    Changes in nighttime lights during the pandemic can also be tied to changes in nitrogen dioxide levels if the data are properly processed and interpreted. This is because nitrogen dioxide is primarily emitted from burning fossil fuels, and highways light up on nighttime satellite imagery when vehicles are present. 
    
    Here we see the illuminated web of highways connecting the Los Angeles metropolitan region.
  
    Researchers are using night light observations to track variations in energy use, migration, and transportation in response to social distancing and shutdown measures during the pandemic.

    These data, collected by the [Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)](https://www.jpss.noaa.gov/viirs.html "Explore the VIIRS product") instrument aboard the joint NASA-National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Suomi-National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite, correlate with changes seen in car traffic on the ground – and, therefore, nitrogen dioxide reductions.

    While this research is still ongoing, the 31% reduction in nitrogen dioxide levels in Los Angeles during the height of pandemic-related lockdowns compared to recent years seems to correspond with a 15% reduction in nighttime lights over highways during the same period.

    ## Measuring Air Pollution on the Ground at Airports
    New research during the pandemic is also looking at how COVID-related travel bans are impacting air quality around airports. Current conditions create a unique opportunity to study airport-related pollutants, especially nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde. While travel bans and strict regulations around air travel have been in place, air traffic has yet to return to previous levels, and many planes remain grounded.

    They are comparing the on-the-ground sensor information from NASA's [Pandora Project](https://pandora.gsfc.nasa.gov/ "Explore the Pandora Project") with satellite information from TROPOMI. So far, they have found that nitrogen dioxide hotspots in Atlanta shifted from the airport, shown here, to the city center from April-June 2020. By September, however, satellites revealed the airport had reemerged as a dominant nitrogen dioxide emission source.

    ## Seeing Rebounds in NO2
  
    After the initial shock of COVID-related shutdowns in the spring, communities worldwide began to reopen and gradually increase mobility. Cars returned to the road, and travel restrictions slowly eased. These resumptions corresponded with relative increases in nitrogen dioxide levels and other air pollutants, as air quality levels began to return to pre-pandemic levels.
    
    This demonstrates how quickly atmospheric nitrogen dioxide responds to reductions in emissions. They will persist as long as emissions persist and decline rapidly if emissions are reduced.
    
    NASA scientists will continue to monitor nitrogen dioxide levels and long-term trends around the world. NASA is expected to launch its [Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO)](http://tempo.si.edu/overview.html "Explore the TEMPO instrument") instrument in 2022, which will provide hourly, high-resolution measurements of nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and other air pollutants across North America, improving future air quality forecasts.
