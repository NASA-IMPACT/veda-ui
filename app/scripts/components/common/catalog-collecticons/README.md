# Catalog Collecticons Baseline

This directory contains a snapshot of the catalog components with collecticon icons, preserved for visual comparison in Storybook during the USWDS icon migration.

## Purpose

- **Baseline Reference**: Preserves the current collecticon implementation
- **Storybook Comparison**: Enables side-by-side comparison with USWDS migrated versions
- **Temporary**: Will be removed once icon migration is complete and verified
