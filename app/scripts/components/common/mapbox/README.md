> :warning: **This component was deprecated**

The `/mapbox` component has been used for the previous Explorer view of the dashboard. We had a different requirement for exploring the datasets at that time so this component was written in a way that only one additional layer was allowed on top of the basemap. 
As the dashboard moves towards [the new E&A page](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard/exploration) with multiple dataset layers, this component was deprecated in favor of the `/map` component.
